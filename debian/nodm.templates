Template: nodm/enabled
Type: boolean
Default: true
_Description: Enable nodm?
 Designed for embedded or kiosk systems, nodm starts an X session
 for a user without asking for authentication. On regular
 machines, this has security implications and is therefore disabled
 by default.
 .
 You should enable nodm only if you need autologin on this machine.

Template: nodm/user
Type: string
Default: root
_Description: User to start a session for:
 Please enter the login name of the user that will automatically be logged into X by nodm.

Template: nodm/first_vt
Type: string
Default: 7
_Description: Lowest numbered vt on which X may start:
 nodm needs to find a free virtual terminal on which to start the X server.
 .
 Since X and getty get to conflict, this parameter will specify the lowest
 numbered virtual terminal on which to start the search.
 .
 This value should be set to one higher than the highest numbered virtual
 terminal on which a getty may start.

Template: nodm/x_options
Type: string
Default: -nolisten tcp
#flag:translate!:3
_Description: Options for the X server:
 Please enter the options to pass to the X server when starting it.
 .
 Format: [/usr/bin/<Xserver>] [:<disp>] <Xserver-options>
 .
 The Xserver executable and the display name can be omitted, but should
 be placed in front, if nodm's defaults shall be overridden.
 .
 If no vtN option is used, nodm will perform automatic vt allocation.

Template: nodm/min_session_time
Type: string
Default: 60
_Description: Minimum time (in seconds) for a session to be considered OK:
 If an X session will run for less than this time in seconds, nodm will wait an
 amount of time before restarting the session. The waiting time will grow
 until a session lasts longer than this amount.

Template: nodm/x_timeout
Type: string
Default: 300
_Description: Maximum time (in seconds) to wait for X to start:
 Timeout (in seconds) to wait for X to be ready to accept connections. If X is
 not ready before this timeout, it is killed and restarted.

Template: nodm/xsession
Type: string
Default: /etc/X11/Xsession
#flag:translate!:3
_Description: X session to use:
 Please choose the name of the X session script to use with nodm.

Template: nodm/daemon_name
Type: string
Default: /usr/sbin/nodm
Description: for internal use only

Template: shared/default-x-display-manager
Type: select
Choices: ${choices}
_Description: Default display manager:
 A display manager is a program that provides graphical login capabilities for
 the X Window System.
 .
 Only one display manager can manage a given X server, but multiple display
 manager packages are installed. Please select which display manager should
 run by default.
 .
 Multiple display managers can run simultaneously if they are configured to
 manage different servers; to achieve this, configure the display managers
 accordingly, edit each of their init scripts in /etc/init.d, and disable the
 check for a default display manager.
