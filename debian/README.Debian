 * Configuration via preseeding

You can configure nodm via debconf preseeding, so that the package will install
without asking any question, and doing what you want.

To do so, before installing the package you can create a file similar to the
output of debconf-get-selections, and run debconf-set-selections with it.

For example, in order to have nodm start as the user 'kiosk', you can save this
file as nodm.preseed:

  # Activate nodm (which is the default, but this suppresses the debconf question)
  nodm nodm/enabled boolean true

  # Login the session as user 'kiosk'
  nodm nodm/user string kiosk

And then run 'debconf-set-selections nodm.preseed' before installing the
package.
